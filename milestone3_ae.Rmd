#Loaded dataset from excel, which details the location and frequencies of gun deaths in 2019. This data was obtained from https://www.gunviolencearchive.org, which is a non-partisan group that collects data on all acts of gun violence in the United States (2013-present).

gundeaths2019 <- read_excel("~/Desktop/raw_data/gundeaths_2019.xlsx")

#I plan to compare the frequency of gun deaths in 2019 by location, to a dataset from OpenSecrets, which details how much each member of the 116th congress receives in donations from gun control versus gun rights lobbiest groups. I also would like to compare this data to the broader ideologies of the area, especially their levels of trust in government. I plan to obtain this data from Pew Research Centre; however, have been having issues downloading the specific dataset I need, and will continue working on this over the weekend.
